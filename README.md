I have an Idea to make a complete e-library, where students can find all of Indian and foreign e-books, according to their topics and departments, also providing some video lectures according to their departmental subjects, and provide them at least 3years previous question papers of all subjects for semester exam. Students can create their own library according to their own choice. An online exam portal will be there where exam / test / assignments will be given for a certain time. In this period student can't get out from the whole project. And after exam a graph will be shown on their screen depending on their last 2 exams, where they are getting improvements in their exams or not. Class and Lab attendance system will be there. They can check their attendance percentage through this. They will get an online routine according to their stream and year for each day of the week, and before ten minutes, they will be notified about their classes. A small hall of fame and past events gallery will be there, where they can see our old events pictures with few description. Internal Chatting with professors regarding video lecture will be there and group video conference may be included for group online classes. They will  get all the new notice and results from the university, as soon as possible.
